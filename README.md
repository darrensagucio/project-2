## Topic: Consumption and Waste: Feeding the Unfed

Our project is to visualize the juxtaposition between the amount of food waste that occurs and the widespread hunger (measured by food insecurity) throughout America. The story we want to convey is the high level of disconnect between the amount of food wasted and the amount of food needed to provide for the food insecure. While we wonâ€™t know the exact numbers until we do the analysis, a huge amount of food insecurity could be solved by repurposing food waste, and we want to visually display these disparities, as visuals can create a much larger impact than pure numbers.
